 This is a awk(*) script that calculates and displays the EI30 erosivity
 index from rainfall gauge records.

 EI calculations, a break between storms is
 defined as 6 h or more with less than 1.3 mm of
 precipitation. Rains less than 13 mm, and separated
 from other storms by 6 or more hours, are moitted
 as insignificant unless the maximum 15 min intensity
 exceeds 24 mm h -1 (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978)

 Note:
 (*)AWK is an interpreted programming language designed for text processing
 and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It is a
 standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems.

# The rainfall energy  is calculated for each time interval as:
# where rain_intensity is the rainfall intensity during 
# the time interval (mm hr -1) (Brown and Foster, 1987)
# returns the energy  in  E(MJ/ha)
#
function energy(rain_intensity)
        {
        res = 0.29 * (1 - 0.72 * exp(-0.05 * rain_intensity))
        return(res)
        }

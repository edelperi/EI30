 EI calculations, a break between storms is
 defined as 6 h or more with less than 1.3 mm of
 precipitation. Rains less than 13 mm, and separated
 from other storms by 6 or more hours, are moitted
 as insignificant unless the maximum 15 min intensity
 exceeds 24 mm h -1 (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978)

 Note:
 (*)AWK is an interpreted programming language designed for text processing
 and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It is a
 standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems.

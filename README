 ================================================
 
 This is a awk(*) script that calculates and displays the EI30 erosivity
 index from rainfall gauge records.
 The sampling interval must be specified at the source code 

 [usage]: ' awk -v interval=5 -f EI30.awk < test_filename.dat'
  
 In this example use a raingauge with a sampling interval equals to 5 minutes
 -v interval =5

 For the EI calculations, a break between storms is
 defined as 6 h or more with less than 1.3 mm of
 precipitation. Rains less than 1.3 mm, and separated
 from other storms by 6 or more hours, are moitted
 as insignificant unless the maximum 15 min intensity
 exceeds 24 mm h^-1 (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978)

 This scrip separate storms with this criterion. Then,
 the rainfall energy  is calculated for each time interval as:


function energy(rain_intensity)
        {
        res = 0.29 * (1 - 0.72 * exp(-0.05 * rain_intensity))
        return(res)
        }

 where rain_intensity is the average rainfall intensity during 
 the time interval espressed as (mm hr -1) (Brown and Foster, 1987).
 The functions returns the energy  in  E(MJ/ha)



Note:

 (*)AWK is an interpreted programming language designed for text processing
 and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It is a
 standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems.
